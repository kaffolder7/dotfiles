# For LLM CLI module
# NOTE:
# OpenAI keys are expected to live in file-based secrets:
#   ~/.config/secrets/openai_api_key
#   ~/.config/secrets/openai_api_key_llm
#   ~/.config/secrets/openai_api_key_codex
# and are injected per-command by zsh helpers (see zshrc.d/70-openai.zsh).
# Avoid exporting OPENAI_API_KEY globally unless you know you want that.
