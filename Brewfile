# -------------------------
# Homebrew bundle file
# -------------------------
#
# Install missing formulae/casks, skip anything already installed, leave extra packages alone (by default)
# Run `brew bundle` on target machine
# 
# Run `brew bundle --cleanup` if you want to uninstall anything not listed in the Brewfile—great for fresh setups, risky for daily use.
# 
# To update Brewfile (manually) after installs:
# `brew bundle dump --force && git commit -am "Update Brewfile" && git push`
# 
# To update Brewfile (dynamically):
# Use cron or launchd to:
# -	Pull repo
# -	Run brew bundle
# -	Works well for a “main laptop → secondary laptop” setup
